    "This is intended as an introduction to coding in the Python 3 language along with some of the more common additional packages used across many industries and disciplines. If you've never coded before in any language then coding can take some practice in order to make sense. On top of the basic rules and commands of each language, there are coding best practices to follow in order to make your code readable by others (or yourself in the future).\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, this is a Jupyter Notebook. It's one of several ways of interacting with the Python programming language. Other ways include the command line (command prompt in windows), Ipython, which is an interactive python shell from which you can write individual lines of code and execute as you go or run entire written programs, and integral development environments (IDEs) like Spyder or Eclipse which make more tools available to you for testing your programs. The distinct advantage of Jupyter Notebooks is that each cell (like this one) is run individually, so if you type a command incorrectly you know exactly where your program breaks and can fix it immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "When coding it is also important to remember that the computer is doing exactly what you **tell** it, which may not be you want it to do. It can be important for you to play around with different commands to understand exactly what each does and how it interacts with your data.\n",

You can run each cell as many times as you like, but if you change anything in a previous cell, you'll need to run all of the code that depends on it afterwards for that update to take place. Try it on the code cell below."

The main piece of any command (or function) is going to be called the argument and will be denoted in the parentheses that follow a command. This is what is given to a command in order to do some task. In the case of `print()` the task is printing the argument out to the user. The print statement can take any variable as input. When giving a text input, place a ' or \" on either side."

Feel free to try some of your own as well by changing the arguments of the print functions above and re-running the cell.\n",

The most common variable types you'll likely deal with in base Python are **integers, floats, strings, and lists**. The nice thing about Python compared to many other languages is that you do not need to specify the type ahead of time. Once you assign a value, it will pick the type. You can check the type by using the `type()` command.\n",

It is far easier to tell what a code does if each variable is descriptive (say position, velocity, acceleration) and not single letters (x, v, a, or x1, x2, x3). It is important to remember the order of this command as `variable = input` and not the other way around."

Code Academy has a \"Pro track\" that you can pay for, but you can also just use the tutorial lessons to learn and skip quizzes and projects. In addition, if you want to practice skills [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) are good resources with unique problems.
